<h1>Sensor Simulator</h1>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>

The only dependency you'll have to install yourself is [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

I highly recommend that you use [atom](https://atom.io) as your editor, along with the `atom-typescript` and `linter-tslint` packages.

I also recommend [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) as your GUI for git and managing the repository.

<h3>Build and Run</h3>

Before you can run the project for the first time, go into the project root directory in your preferred command-line interface and run `npm run -s setup`.

After that, you only need to run `npm run -s run` to build and run the application each time.

<h3>Making Changes</h3>

Changes should be made to the typescript files in the `src` directory. Any files under `build` or any other directory are not tracked by git and should not be changed.

Once your changes are made, create a [pull request](https://github.com/erkalicious/sensor-simulator/compare) and the rest of us will review it and merge it :).
